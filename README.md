### ¡Hola!

I am Ricardo Muñoz Sánchez (he/him), welcome to my GitHub!

I recently started a PhD in natural language processing (NLP) at Göteborgs Universitet and the main topic of my research is bias and fairness in NLP for second language learning.
Other topics I'm passionate about is fake news and misinformation and environmentalism and sustainablility.

A bit more about my background - I did my undergraduate degree in mathematics at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) back in Mexico.
Later on, I moved to Scotland to do a masters in artificial intelligence at the University of Edinburgh. You can see more of my projects and other shenanigans in [my website](https://rimusa.github.io/).

Technology is a powerful tool that has opened doors that were previously closed to humanity.
However, I believe that, as with all tools, it should be used responsibly and with the aim of making a positive change in society.

I'm looking to collaborate on interesting NLP projects!
