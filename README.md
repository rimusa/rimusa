### ¡Hola!

I am Ricardo Muñoz Sánchez (he/him/his), welcome to my GitHub!

I studied my undergraduate degree in Math and recently finished a masters degree in Artificial Intelligence.
I am currently interested in natural language processing (NLP) applications and in fairness in AI.

Technology is a powerful tool that has opened doors that were previously closed to humanity.
However, I believe that, as with all tools, it should be used responsibly and with the aim of making a positive change in society.

My masters dissertation was on bias and fairness in NLP, more specifically, on how altering the bias in word embeddings can affect downstream tasks.
Me and some of my colleagues have recently submitted a paper to a conference in which we expand upon these results, the preprint can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15859).

I'm looking to collaborate on interesting NLP projects!
